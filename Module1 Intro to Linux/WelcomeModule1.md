## Welcome to Level 1!

This is the second iteration of the Linux Fundamentals course by WithYouWithMe. The goal of this course is to bring Linux from some magic word into something that's a necessary part of your toolbox.

By the end of this course, you will...

- **Be able to list differences between Linux based Operating Systems and other modern Operating Systems**
- **Be able to to install, utilize, and customize a Linux environment on several platforms**
- **Operate shells in traditional Linux environments**
    - Be able to list the purpose of common linux directories
    - Demonstrate ability to enter, manipulate, and delete files and directories
    - Design automation tasks in a Linux environment (Cron Jobs, scripting)
- **Repeat basic methodologies for researching unfamiliar situations in Linux**
    - Given an unfamiliar command, you'll demonstrate how to research functionality
    - Given desired functionality, you'll demonstrate how to find a corresponding command
    - Given some arbitrary error, you'll be able to go through basic troubleshooting steps to diagnose and solve errors
- **Implement user account controls in a Linux environment**
- **Examine processes and system resource usage**

This might seem like alot especially if you've never touched Linux in the past, but we will be taking every step slowly and methodically. We will start with the basics of what an operating system is and features that make a Linux based operating system different than others. After establishing differences as well as a foundational understanding of an operating system, we will build on that knowledge by introducing functionality in an easy to consume manner.

To emphasize the differences of a Linux environment and to further expose you to the use of a shell (or terminal) this course will be taught with the use of emulated terminals. There will be no GUI and 100% of the practical application for this course will have you interacting with a terminal. It will take a bit of practice to become comfortable in the environment but with some patience and maybe some extra review, you'll be a Linux pro in no time!

In Module 1 we will be laying a foundation for why you should care about Linux and exactly what it is. By revisiting some concepts touched on in previous courses, we can build off of an established foundation and see where Linux really thrives in comparison to some other alternatives like Windows based operating systems. So let's dive right in!
