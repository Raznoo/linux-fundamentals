## Welcome!

This is the second iteration of the Linux Fundamentals course by WithYouWithMe. The goal of this lesson is to bring Linux from some magic word into something that's a necessary part of your toolbox.

By the end of this course, you will...

- **Understand the difference between Linux based operating systems and others**
- **Understand how to install and customize a Linux environment on several platforms**
- **Understand how to navigate the Linux command line**
- **Be able to classify networking tools in a Linux environment**
    - Demonstrate proficiency with tool A by setting up a firewall
    - **do thing 2**
    
- **Be able to administer user and group management in a Linux environment**
- **Be exposed to basic troubleshooting steps and research methodologies related to Linux**
- **Be comfortable managing process and monitoring system usage in a Linux environment**

This might seem like alot especially if you've never touched Linux in the past, but we will be taking every step slowly and methodically. We will start with the basics of what an operating system is and features that make a Linux based operating system different than others. After establishing differences as well as a foundational understanding of an operating system, we will build on that knowledge by introducing functionality in an easy to consume manner.

To emphasize the differences of a Linux environment and to further expose you to the use of a shell (or terminal) this course will be taught with the use of emulated terminals as well as Ubuntu Server. There will be no GUI and 100% of the practical application for this course will have you interacting with a terminal. It will take a bit of practice to become comfortable in the environment but with some patience and maybe some extra review, you'll be a Linux pro in no time!
